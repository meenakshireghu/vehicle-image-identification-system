# Vehicle Image Identification System
A machine learning-based image classification system that categorizes vehicle images into four distinct classes: ships, planes, bikes, and cars. The project uses Python and popular libraries for data preprocessing, visualization, and classification.
## Overview
The **Vehicle Image Identification System** demonstrates an efficient pipeline for image classification. Leveraging image processing with OpenCV and machine learning with Support Vector Machine (SVM), it achieves accurate classification of vehicle images into predefined categories.
